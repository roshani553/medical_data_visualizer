# Medical Data Visualizer

# Description

This project performs data analysis and visualization on a medical dataset.
It helps in understanding relationships between health indicators such as cholesterol, glucose, BMI, blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease (cardio).

The project cleans the dataset, creates new calculated columns, and visualizes the data using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

* Normalizes cholesterol and **glucose** levels for easier comparison.
  
* Displays categorical plots showing health habits vs cardiovascular condition.
 
* Generates a correlation heatmap to identify relationships among medical features.
